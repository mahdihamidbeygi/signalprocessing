# Signal Processing Project

This project provides tools for seismic signal processing and analysis, with a focus on waveform analysis, pulse identification, and wavelet analysis.

## Project Components

- `signal_process.py`: Main signal processing module containing core functionality for seismic data analysis
- `pulse_identifier.py`: Module for identifying and analyzing seismic pulses
- `waveletAnalysis.py`: Implementation of wavelet analysis techniques
- `waveletFunctions.py`: Supporting functions for wavelet analysis operations

## Features

- Signal processing and analysis capabilities
- Waveform analysis with SNR filtering
- Zero-crossing analysis
- Coda wave analysis
- Pulse identification and characterization
- Wavelet-based signal analysis

## Requirements

The project requires several Python packages, which can be installed using the provided `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Key dependencies include:
- BEAT (for seismic analysis)
- Pyrocko (for seismic data handling)
- Additional scientific computing packages (numpy, scipy, etc.)

## Data Requirements

The project requires velocity models in two formats:
- `.npz` format
- `.nd` format

## Usage

Detailed usage instructions and examples will be added here.
